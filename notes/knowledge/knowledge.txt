-- Knowledge based agents: agents that reason by operating 
on internal representations of Knowledge

    - If it didnt rain, Harry visited Hagrid today.
    - Harry visited Hagrid or Dumbledore today, but not both.
    - Harry visited Dumbledore today.

    - Consider these three pieces of intelligence in the 
    "knowledge base". As humans, based on this knowledge, 
    we can conclude that:
        1. Harry did not visit Hagrid today
        2. It rained today

    - How can we make an agent reason the same way?

    - Symbols 

    1.  P           Q           R 
        ^           ^           ^
                statements

    - What is actually true in the world?

        - Model: assignment of a truth value to every
        propositional symbol 
        e.g {P = true, Q = false}

        - Knowledge base: a set of sentences known by 
        a knowledge-based agent

        - Entailment 

            a |= b 

            In every model in which a is true, then
            b is also true. (eg a = its tuesday in jan
                            b = its jan)

        - Inference: the process of deriving new 
        sentences from old sentences

            - Example

                1.  P: its tuesday 
                    Q: its raining
                    R: Harry will go for a run 

                    knowledge base KB: 
                        (P ^ -Q) --> R
                        P
                        -Q
                    
                    Inference: R 
            
            - Inference algorithms

                Main question: Does KB |= a?

                1. Model Checking

                    To determine if KB |= a, 

                        1. Enumerate all possible models (consider
                        all possible truth values for statements)

                        2. If in every model where KB is true, a
                        is true, then KB |= a. Otherwise, 
                        KB !|= a
